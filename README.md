This is a port of [shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks).

shadowsocks is a fast tunnel proxy that helps you bypass firewalls.

## Dependencies

* libcrypto (OpenSSL) (Required for `aes-cfb-*` and `rc4` ciphers)
* libsodium >= 1.0.7 (Required for ciphers that are provided by libsodium)

## Build & Install

### Optional Features

* `sodium` - Enabled linking to [`libsodium`](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium), which will also enable ciphers that depending on `libsodium`.

* `rc4` - Enabled `rc4` encryption algorithm. Some OpenSSL Crypto does not ship with `rc4`, because it was already deprecated in 2015.

* `aes-cfb` - Enabled `aes-*-cfb` encryption algorithm.

* `aes-ctr` - Enabled `aes-*-ctr` encryption algorithm.

* `camellia-cfb` - Enabled `camellia-*-cfb` encryption algorithm.

* `single-threaded` - Let `sslocal` and `ssserver` run in single threaded mode (by using Tokio's `basic_scheduler`).

Default features: `["sodium", "rc4", "aes-cfb", "aes-ctr"]`.

NOTE: To disable dependency of OpenSSL, just disable feature `rc4`, `aes-cfb`, `aes-ctr`, `camellia-cfb`.

### **crates.io**

Install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/shadowsocks-rust):

```bash
cargo install shadowsocks-rust
```

then you can find `sslocal` and `ssserver` in `$CARGO_HOME/bin`.

### **Download release**

Requirements:

* Linux x86\_64

Download static-linked build [here](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/releases).

### **Build from source**

Use cargo to build.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

NOTE: If you haven't installed the correct version of `libsodium` in your system, you can set a environment variable `SODIUM_BUILD_STATIC=yes` to let `libsodium-ffi` to build `libsodium` from source, which requires you to have build tools (including GCC, libtools, etc.) installed.

```bash
SODIUM_BUILD_STATIC=yes cargo build --release
```

Then `sslocal` and `ssserver` will appear in `./target/(debug|release)/`, it works similarly as the two binaries in the official ShadowSocks' implementation.

```bash
make install TARGET=release
```

Then `sslocal`, `ssserver` and `ssurl` will be installed in `/usr/local/bin` (variable PREFIX).

For Windows users, if you have encountered any problem in building, check and discuss in [#102](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/issues/102).

### **Build standalone binaries**

Requirements:

* Docker

```bash
./build/build-release
```

Then `sslocal`, `ssserver` and `ssurl` will be packaged in

* `./build/shadowsocks-latest-release.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
* `./build/shadowsocks-latest-release.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.xz`

Read `Cargo.toml` for more details.

## Getting Started

Create a ShadowSocks' configuration file. Example

```json
{
    "server": "my_server_ip",
    "server_port": 8388,
    "local_address": "127.0.0.1",
    "local_port": 1080,
    "password": "mypassword",
    "timeout": 300,
    "method": "aes-256-cfb"
}
```

Detailed explanation could be found in [shadowsocks' documentation](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/wiki).

In shadowsocks-rust, we also have an extended configuration file format, which is able to define more than one servers:

```json
{
    "servers": [
        {
            "address": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 1080,
            "password": "hello-world",
            "method": "bf-cfb",
            "timeout": 300
        },
        {
            "address": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 1081,
            "password": "hello-kitty",
            "method": "aes-128-cfb"
        }
    ],
    "local_port": 8388,
    "local_address": "127.0.0.1"
}
```

The `sslocal` will use a load balancing algorithm to dispatch packages to all servers.

Start local and server ShadowSocks with
If you Build it with Makefile:

```bash
sslocal -c config.json
ssserver -c config.json
```

If you Build it with Cargo:

```bash
cargo run --bin sslocal -- -c config.json
cargo run --bin ssserver -- -c config.json
```

List all available arguments with `-h`.

## Usage

### Socks5 Local client

```bash
# Read local client configuration from file
sslocal -c /path/to/shadowsocks.json

# Pass all parameters via command line
sslocal -b "127.0.0.1:1080" -s "[::1]:8388" -m "aes-256-gcm" -k "hello-kitty" --plugin "obfs-local" --plugin-opts "obfs=tls"

# Pass server with SIP002 URL
sslocal -b "127.0.0.1:1080" --server-url "ss://YWVzLTI1Ni1nY206cGFzc3dvcmQ@127.0.0.1:8388/?plugin=obfs-local%3Bobfs%3Dtls"
```

### Tunnel Local client

```bash
# Read local client configuration from file
# Set 127.0.0.1:8080 as the target for forwarding to
sstunnel -c /path/to/shadowsocks.json -f "127.0.0.1:8080"
```

`sstunnel` basically works the same as `sslocal`, only it doesn't have any client negociation process, just establishes a tunnel to the `forward` address.

### Server

```bash
# Read server configuration from file
ssserver -c /path/to/shadowsocks.json

# Pass all parameters via command line
ssserver -s "[::]:8388" -m "aes-256-gcm" -k "hello-kitty" --plugin "obfs-server" --plugin-opts "obfs=tls"
```

## Supported Ciphers

* `aes-128-cfb`, `aes-128-cfb1`, `aes-128-cfb8`, `aes-128-cfb128`
* `aes-192-cfb`, `aes-192-cfb1`, `aes-192-cfb8`, `aes-192-cfb128`
* `aes-256-cfb`, `aes-256-cfb1`, `aes-256-cfb8`, `aes-256-cfb128`

* `rc4`, `rc4-md5`
* `chacha20`, `salsa20`, `chacha20-ietf`
* `plain` (No encryption, just for debugging)

### AEAD Ciphers

* `aes-128-gcm`, `aes-256-gcm`
* `chacha20-ietf-poly1305`, `xchacha20-ietf-poly1305`
* `aes-128-pmac-siv`, `aes-256-pmac-siv` (experimental)

## Useful Tools

1. `ssurl` is for encoding and decoding ShadowSocks URLs (SIP002). Example:

    ```plain
    ss://YWVzLTI1Ni1jZmI6cGFzc3dvcmQ@127.0.0.1:8388/?plugin=obfs-local%3Bobfs%3Dhttp%3Bobfs-host%3Dwww.baidu.com
    ```

## Notes

It supports the following features:

* [x] Socks5 CONNECT command
* [x] UDP ASSOCIATE command (partial)
* [x] Various crypto algorithms
* [x] Load balancing (multiple servers) and server delay checking
* [x] [SIP004](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-org/issues/30) AEAD ciphers
* [x] [SIP003](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-org/issues/28) Plugins
* [x] [SIP002](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-org/issues/27) Extension ss URLs

## TODO

* [x] Documentation
* [x] Extend configuration format
* [x] Improved logging format (waiting for the new official log crate)
* [ ] Support more ciphers without depending on `libcrypto` (waiting for an acceptable Rust crypto lib implementation)
* [x] Windows support.
* [x] Build with stable.
* [ ] Support HTTP Proxy protocol (it is easy to use another tools to convert HTTP proxy protocol to Socks5, like `privoxy`)
* [ ] One-time Auth. (Already deprecated according to Shadowsocks' community)
* [x] AEAD ciphers. (proposed in [SIP004](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-org/issues/30), still under discussion)
* [x] Choose server based on delay #152
